# Core Framework - Template - Examples
This repository is the next evolution in CommonCore; simply called Core.  Instead of using nuget to install the various packets and then manually setting up the project, this repository will provide solution templates that will kick things off.

 - Core.Reference.zip: Contains a blank Solution with a single page and starter files and folders initialized.  
 - CommonCore Projects.zip: Contains the shared projects for Core and extensions like SQlite, LiteDb and Fonts. 
 - Code Samples: Contains examples of how to use Core and the extensions. 
 
 (NOTE)  The template and examples require that you include Xamarin.Forms.Core shared project in order to compile and run.
